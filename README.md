FitForward: Intelligent NLP-Based Resume Feedback System
FitForward is an innovative project designed to enhance the job application experience for candidates by providing personalized feedback on their resumes. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system compares candidate resumes against job descriptions, identifies skill gaps, and generates actionable feedback.

Key Features
Resume Feedback System: Automatically compares resumes with job descriptions to highlight areas of improvement.
Advanced NLP Techniques: Utilizes Python, spaCy, and KeyBERT for extracting and analyzing keywords.
Cosine Similarity and TF-IDF: Employs advanced text matching techniques to ensure precise evaluation of candidate suitability.
Personalized Feedback: Generates meaningful and actionable feedback, enabling candidates to align their resumes better with job requirements.
PDF Resume Support: Designed to process resumes uploaded in PDF format for seamless analysis.
Technical Highlights
Data Processing:
Analyzed over 200+ resumes using job-specific keywords extracted with NLP techniques.
Extracted text and features from PDF resumes with PyPDF and spaCy preprocessing.
Machine Learning Integration:
Achieved 85%+ accuracy in matching resumes to job descriptions using Cosine Similarity and TF-IDF.
Feedback Categorization:
Feedback includes categorized insights into technical skills, soft skills, and domain knowledge.
Streamlit Integration:
User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for uploading resumes and receiving feedback instantly.
How It Works
Upload Resume: Candidates upload their resumes in PDF format.
Input Job Description: Job descriptions are either provided manually or preloaded from a dataset.
Resume Analysis:
Extracts and preprocesses the resume and job description text.
Calculates similarity scores using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
Feedback Generation:
Identifies missing skills and provides actionable insights for improvement.
Download Feedback: Generates a downloadable report for candidates to review.
